Journey to Comzaugylzt. 16 5

ancient that I saw: the one whose figure bespoke it the most ancient
is here represented3 its date, Ι think, makes it not 200 year old. The
Danes indeed have left here some monu-
ments of antiquity which I have not 11101
with elsewhere, and these arc forts, not cast
up with earth and trenches as usu-all, but
wholly compos'd of 5101105 heap'd round in
a circle of the connnon compass. Tho* they
are now old and ruin⁷d‚ and alhnost defac’d‚
they still have the appearance of Danish
forts, and are so call'd and generally repu-
ted in ye country, tho' indeed I do not find
their common 1110111115 or forts so frequent
in these parts to conclude they ever had
here so good footing as in ye N. Ε. parts of Ireland, which lay more
opportune sor their invasions and setleinent. They have here a sort
of ropes made osye roots of firr trees¹'‚ here frequently dug out of the
boggs z these they beat like hemp, and then twist them into roaps3
they are pretty flexible, and Ι am told, more lasting, especially in
dalnp places, than any other cords : they are made in Α11110110, and
are much us'd for cording beds in dalnp clay floors, where they last
for ever, whereas till they made these roaps they were us'd to change
their hemp cords every day.

&Valking here in γε fields, 111101 with an odd stone all spotted white
at 0110 end, ye spots continuing in white streaks down the side of the
stone. Breaking it, we found in y⁴³ body of y² stone answering to each

 

white spot a long tract or round vein of a more flinty substance than ye
rest of ye stone. Of this stone Ihave some pieces by 1110, ye 5110115 and
round

¹¹ Rape-3 made qf the root-s· (gf fir trees, parts of the country for cording hedstemlx,
are still used by 1110 peasantry in many and for lines for drying linen.
