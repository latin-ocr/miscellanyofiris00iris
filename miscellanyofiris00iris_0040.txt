Libe›·tatzmz.—Tl1ese Irish liberties are called Counties Palatine by Davies, p. 108 ;
but I have not found that name given to 1110111 111 any Irish record. They seem to
have resembled more closely the Regalities of scotland, than the great English Coun-
ties Palatine. The power of the Lords of these Liberties was very great, yet it has
been thought to have been greater than it was. Under the short and comprehensive
charters of Henry 1110 Second they claimed, justly or unjustly, the pleas of the Crown‚
and almost unrestricted authorityg but although the recognition os these pleas was
resumed, at least by the Lord of Meath (see Roc. Pat. 2 Hen. V. 137), yet in the
confirmation charters ofKing J 01111, whose bad reputation in England has hitherto pre-
vented justice from being done to his exertions in the settle-ment of Ireland, there are
introduced saving clauses to protect the rights of the Crown, and to limit the power of
the lord over his bal-ons, especially an appcal was given in all cases from the lord's
court to that of the king 3 ancl in this Parliarnent we have the appointment of a She-
riff to make executions in the liberties‚ when the seneschall or lord's officer should be
found in default. With these restrictions it does not 500111 that it was an unwise mea-
sure to introduce the Feudal system in planting a court of justice in every barony
under the baron, giving an appeal from it to 1110 court of the lord of the liberty, and
from the court of the liberty to the court of the king, the supreme lord:, nor must wc
sorget that the natural progress of settled governnicnt (and Henry II. could scarcely
have anticipated the 001111111οε of confusion which have followed) would have been to
break down any privilege of their immediate lord, which was grating to the lesser
Barons and tenants, who could always fly from their petty tyrant to the protection of
the throne. Whatever may have been the constitutional and political results of these
great Feudal Lorclships, the Lords assumed the state ancl ceremony of princes 3 they
had their Treasurers, and Chaucellors‚ and Barons of the Exchequer. The townlands
osMarshallstown and Seneschallstown, indicate the sees of the Marshall and Seneschal
of the Lord of Meath, and even the subordinate Baron of Slane had his standard-
bearer. It is in all Iikclihood to their imitation os this pageantry of the English
Lords that the Irish chieftains were indebted for the names, if not for the services of
some of the officers of their petty murts—Hy-Dlanjs, p. 86, n. k.

For much information about these liberties we refer to the valuable works of Sir W.
Betham and Mr. Wissiam Lynch, 011 Feudal Dignities‚ who have supported their oppo-
site views on the interesting and still debateable question of the peculiaritics of the
Irish peerage, with great acutmess, and have brought sorward many documents,
which illustrate Irish history, which are not to be found in any other printed works.
