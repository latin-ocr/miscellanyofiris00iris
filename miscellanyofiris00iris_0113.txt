Obits (gf Kilcormz‘ck. 99

Am. VI. Obits qs'Kilcormlck.

HE following obituary notices are taken from a Missal in the

Library of Trinity College‚ Dublin³‚ a MS. of the fourteenth
or fifteenth century, formerly belonging to the Carmelitc Monastery
of the Blessed Virgin Mary, founded in Kjleormiok, now Frankfort,
in the King's County, by Odo, or Aedh‚ son of Nellan O’Molloy‚ at
the beginning of the fifteenth centuryb.

The obituary noticeS‚ several of which are of the 16th century,
all occur in the calendar prefixed to the Missal. The first leaf,
which contained the months of January and February, is unfortu-
nately lost, and the calendar now begins with March.

On the first page of the first leaf now remaining are the following
entries in a hand of the sixteenth century:

“ Missale Kilcormick.'’

‘⁴ This was a booke belonging to the Abbey of Kilcorinick, in the King⁷s
County.''

On the upper margin:

“ Obiit tyn-letus filius Dathei ac Kasredus filius maricii yc'ondubmp, anno
domini 1110. cccc0. xe0. 3⁰. autumpni in inicio.'’

The word Kafredus is erased, and over it, in a somewhat later
hand, is written Karolus.

On the lower margin :

“ Obiit Ruoricus o'mohnoy filius eiusdem niellani ac et capetaneus nacionis
(le ferkell in die paraschcue anno domini 1n⁰. ccccm. xxxi0. cuius anime propi-

cietur Deus. Amen⁰.'’
