tates from the kings, prinees, and nobility in every parte of the kingdome to
maintaine them, and enable them to discharge that function‚ whereby Ireland
formerly was called Sophiae Magistra, Insula Sanctorum, genetrix Sophiaeque
Magistra, et Hibernia: this estate from the Milesian invasion to the present
age, was continued to the said Antiquaiyes, Druides, Bards, ete., till our nobility
lost all their estates to a few3 but at this day, as poore as wee are, wee have
a greate value for those desoended from the said antiquaryes, ete., who pre-
served and recorded our descents, scates, relation, titles, ete„ and left it to us
in weather-beaten parelnnents standing for thousands of yeares. Other countryes
being totally subdued, enslaved, banished, or killed by other barbarous nations‚
could not preserve their monumental reeords, as England, WV-ales, ete„ for the
invaders made it their business to destroy the honor-able records of the nations
they eonquered, and to bring them all into ignoranee and oblivion, a piece of
poliey: but our country of Ireland was never subdued till the present age, nor
have we lost any of our reeords a principio 3 tho’ the Cromwellians out os zeale
to God, and for tender feare of tolerating or eonniving at any superstition, for-

our Irish kings and princes, with their names, but have none now in hand, and

Roderieke O'Connor (in whose rcigne Hen. y·e 2¹l 0111110 into Ireland), had silver
and gold coined for him at Cloonmac-cnos‚ and so had his father, Tordelvachus
(⁷)'Connor⁷ King of Ireland, and several of our kings, as our records attest.

‘⁸ For old Irish manuscripts, I, Thady Roddy, of Crossefield, in the province
os Conaught, and county ofLeytri1n‚ Esquire, have as many Irish books ol'
Philosophy, Physieke, Poetry, Genealogys, Mathematicke, Invasions, Law,
Romanees, ete, and as ancient as any in Ireland, and so has several others in all
partes of the kingdome. My honored friend, Mr. Roger Flaherty, lost a curious
volume of the Mathematies the last warrc, in Gallway, which I lent him, the
losse whereof 110 wonderfully condoles in a letter to me; that greate man's sense
of the losse osso rare a piece piercing his noble vinds, for being the instrument
thei-eof, and blaming me in his letter for lending him the booke (tho⁷ nothing
in the world was more wellcome to him than the sanie, nor more ardently

courted),
