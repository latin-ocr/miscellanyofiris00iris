Poem attributed to St. Colmnblcille,

Nor the sreod, nor a destiny³⁰ on the earthly world³⁷,

Nor a son, nor chance, nor woman,

My Druid is Christ, the Son of God,-
Christ, the son of Mary, the great abbot‚

The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit—
My estates are with the King of kings‚

My order is at Celiannus³³ and Moen³⁹.

It should have been noticed in the introductory remarks prefixed
to this poem, that the occasion upon which it was composed is said

and there are preserved in the Library of
Trinity College, Dublin‚ H, 3, 17, a eu-
rious notice of the mode of interpreting
the warblings of the wren and the eroak-
ings of the raven. Dpeon is thus derived
in Corniac’s Glossary: ‘oneum .1. οῃω en,
.1. e'n oo n· pdupzme. Dmm, i. e. adruid-
bird, i. e. a bird which makes a prediction'
[prophecy] This derivation is illustrated
by a passage in the Life of St. Moling, pre-
served in a MS. in Marsh's Library, 3, 1,
4, fol. 70, in which the following reference
is made to the zcren. “Quodam die lc—
gens sanctus pontifex Molyng sedendo in
quodam loco oum suo ministro, venit ad
euin illa avis quae dicitur mayas avium, eo
quod aliquibus praebet auguriun13 et ipsa
est minima, et habebat illa muscam vivam
et ululantem in rostro sno.''

''¹’' Nor the sreod norarleslinffi-—NG speon
nu Γὲη. The word ren and reor'n is used
in MSS. to denote sate, destiny, ebanem
and it is stated in Cormac’s Glossary that
it was a word used by the Druids for des-

tiny.

³7 On the eccrthly world—Pop bne-ee.
bne-ee is very frequently used in the best
Irish poems and prose tracts to denote this
present world. It seems to be compounded
of buzi, life, existence, and ce, Greek γη, the
earth, but Irish glossographers are not
agreed upon its derivation. In the Gaelic
translation ofPsalm lxxxix. 1 1, xc. z, Cru-
innece is used to denote the globe osthe
earth ς but this seems acompound formed by
the translator himself. bn} ce is the eoni-

pound always used by the ancient Irish.
