This latter Tadhg or Teige, son of William‚ being the same who
begins the foregoing geuealogy, and sor whom the Book of Fenagh
was written.

To return to our Author. IIe was an eminent Irish scholar, and
a great patron of Irish literature. He was also the author of some
pieces, both in the Irish and Latin languages. Mr. O⁷Donovan‚ in a
letter to the writer of this notice, says :

“From a MS. which was formerly in the possession os Edward O’Reilly,
and is still in Dublin, it appears that O'Roddy was a practising lawyer during
the reign of King James II., and that he went to England on the business os
the Irish Catholics at that period. This MS. contains some os his Latin com-
positions‚ and one Irish poem, addressed to O’Duigenan, also an elegy in
English, on the death of a young gentleman‚ named Mac Namara, by his
brother, whom O'Roddy had instructed ‘ from a young Virgilian' in the Latin,
Greek, French, Spanish‚ and Irish languagcs. This MS. also contains a poem
by the same youth, lamenting the state of the ti1ncs; and another by Mac Ward,
describingthe dwelling of O’Roddy, inwhich there was a collection of old swords,

and other ancient curiosities.”

O'Roddy was a great patron of Irish literature, and well skilled in
the ancient dialects of the language. ΜΓ. Hardiman has published in
his “ Irish Minstrelsy¹,'’ an ode to Brian na Murtha O'Rourke, written
in 1 566, in the Bearla Feine, or ancient F enian dialect of Irish, by John
Mac Torua O'Mulconry ε to this ode, in the MS. from which Mr.
Hardiman printed, there was a gloss in our O’Roddy's hand-writing,
explaining the obsolete words, which proves him to have been a master
of the ancient dialects. Mr. Hardiman has preserved this gloss, with-
out which the poem would now be very obscure to the best Irish

scholars.
