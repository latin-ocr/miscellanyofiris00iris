Ji'z'rovan-a very renowned mam—T his was the celebrated Francis Kirwun, Bishop
of Killala‚ whose life, written by Doctor John Lynch‚ is mentioned p. 68, (note).
'she compilers of the foregoing pedigree have erroneously stated, that Doetor Kirwan
died in A. D. 1654; but it appears from his life, that he was banished from Ireland 111
A. D. 1655, and that his death took place at Rennes‚ in France, on 27th August,
A. D. 1616. Icon, p. roz: “die 27 Augusti hora noctis undecima, ultimum emisit
spiritua—et die Dominica, postridie illius diei qua extinctus est, concionatores euin
fuisse virum praedicabant, cujus vita plurimam sanctitatem redolebat.”—p. 103. See
also Hib. Dominio-ana, p. 490. Some additional light might be thrown on the lise of
this venerable prolate, but here it would be irrelevant.

The family of Kirwan, recte O'Kirwan (uu Οιαῃῃαϋάνι), is purely Irish, and not os
Saxon or Anglo-Norman origin, as has been erroneously supposed by some members
os the name. This is a fact which was well-known to the late distinguished philoso-
pher, Riehard Kirwan, a member of this family, who was au honour to his name and
country3 and it was by him duly appreciated. That learned individual considered
the Milesian families of Ireland, if not superior, to be, at least, no way inferior to the
English or Anglo-Norman adventurers, who first came hither in the twelsth century.
The following judicial document, relating to this family of O'Kirwan, is taken from
the original, dated A. D. 1485, preserved in the Collegiate Library of Galway.
