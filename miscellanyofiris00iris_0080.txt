NOTES.

Perleyree quoctor Domnick Lynclc.—During the two eventfu] centuries which suc-
‹·eeded the era ot' the Reformation, many of the natives of Ireland, particularly those of
the Milesian racc, were obliged to fly to foreign climes3 and thatin such numbers. that
their fiights were commonly compared to those os wild geese, a name by which the exiles
themselves were often designated. They sought asylums in different parts os Europe,
but chiefly in Francc and Spain, where they were always sure of meeting with a
favourable reception. thenever it happened, that any of these emigrants were ad-
vanced to places os trust or emolument in the countrics of their adoption, either in the
Chureh, through their piety and learning, or in the State, by their military ser-
vices3 or that they advaneed themselves by coinmercial pursuits, or matrimonial alli-
ancesg such persons naturally became anxious to shew their friends or connexions
ahmam that they were rcspectably deseended and connected at home. It. morem-er.
became imperative on those elected or appointed to posts of dignity and honour, es-
pecially in Spain, to prove their patrician origin in the most satisfactory manner.
For those purposes they were aeeustomed to obtain from Ireland, genealogical tables,
and other authenticated testimonials of their dement, and hence arose the numerous
pcdigrees, and other heraldic notiees os Irish familieS, so frequently met with in those
vountries.

The ‘⁶ Pedigree of Doctor Domnick Lynch‚” now first printed from a manuscript
in the possession of the Editor, originated in the manner above stated. That learned
person was elected Regent os the University os Seville, and also Professor ot* Divinity

there.
