castle of Bunowen, in the west of the county of Galway‚ where they
still possess several thousand acres of mountainous land& The last
head of this family (who wrote his name Geoghegan, without the
prefix Ma or Mac), conceiving a dislike to his name, because in Eng-
land he found it difficult to get it correctly written or pronounced, was
induced to apply to ang George IV„ for license to change it to
O'NeilL which name he selected because it sounded well in English
ears, and was one of great celebrity 111 Irish history3 and also because
he thought hc had every claim to 11, 115 1119 Mageoghegans were
descended froinNiall of the Nine Hostages‚ and⁷ therefore, regarded
as a brauch of the southern Hy-Niall race. This license was granted,

Such of the family, however, as have remained in the original 19111-

his name Mageoghegan, according to the original and correct angli—
cised form. The Abbe J. Ma-Geoghegan‚ who published 1115 Histoire

dr Z’Irlamle at Paris, in 1758, was the last that retained the old name.

lord before Sir Hugh de Lacy's time, comprised the districts of Calry,
Brawny, Cuircne, now the barony of Kilkenny west, besides the
