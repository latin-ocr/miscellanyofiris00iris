ART. XIV-The Annals ofI1²eZa7zd‚fi‘0m the 'ear 1443 to 1468, trans-
lated from the I risle hy Dudley Firbz'sse‚ ον, as he is 'more usually
called, Duald Μαο F irbi-§jor Sir James W are, in tlte Year 1 666.

F this translation there are three copies extant, one in the Library
Ο 01 1116 British Mnsenm, Cod. Clareni tom. 68, Ayscough, 4799,
Plut. cxv. E, which is in Mac Firbis's own hand, and commences
p. 47.

The second copy is preserved in the Library of Trinity College,
Dublin, Class F. 1⁷ 18. This seems to have been made for Daniel
Molyneux, Ulstcr King at Arms, by a very incompetent scribe, who
has mistaken many of the proper names 01 111611 and places, and even
corrupted the ‘text in various ways. The third copy is preserved
among Harris⁷s Collections in the Library 01 1116 Royal Dublin So-
eiety: it is in Harris's own hand, and appears to have been made
from the Trinity College copy, but Harris has evidently corrected
some obvious blunders of the transcriber.

It is now difficult to determine from what compilation 01 Annals
Mac Firbis has made this translation, as it does not agree in matter
or arrangement with the Annals of the Four Masters, or any compi-
lation of Annals accessible to the Editor in Dublin or in England.
Harris, in his edition 01 1Ψ3165 1313110113, at Tuam, under John [de
Bmyo} has the following observation on this translation, p. 612:

‘⁶ One John was consecrated about the close 01 1116 year 1441. [Sir <sames
[Varo declares he could not discover when he (h'ed; and adds that some called
him John de Βιωῃο, but that he could not answer for the Truth of that name]
But both these particulars are cleared up, and his immediate successor named
by thdley Firhisse, an Ammzxztevsis, whom Sir ιῙιυηρδ 11111116 employed in his
House to translate and collect sor him from the Irislz Manuscripts ; one os whose
pieces begins thus, viz. ⁴ This Translation beginncd was by Drcdley Firbz‘sse in
the House of Sir James 111116, 111 Gesila-street, Dablin, 6th 01 November 1666,'
