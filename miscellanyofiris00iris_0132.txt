but found not a stone of it remaining; even the name Crossfield (so called from
an old stone cross, which was destroyed by the Cromwellians), is forgotten. His
reply to Shane Ballagh O'Duigenan, which I have read, is very curious‚ and
written in the true spirit of the Irish language. I have no specimen of his Latin
hexameters, but I have read several of them, and they evince considerable
knowledge of that language In 1702, when he was nearly ninety years old, he
wrote the following note, on a difficult‚ conti-acted passage, in the Book os
Fenagh:

“ Η15 ancestor Tadhg, son of William O'Rody, who was married to Honora,
the daughter of O'Molloy, in 1 5¹7> 15 described 111 1110 Book of F enagh as a Latin
aud Scotio scholar, and a composcr of Sedna poetry‚ a man who kept a house for
general hospitality, as recommended and enjoined by St. camin, and in whose
time it was expected that the prophecies of St. Caillin, respecting the wealth
:uid ‹lignity of F enagh, would be fulfilled.”

O'ReiHy, in his short account of our author, states that “the author
of the Curiosities of Literature represents 111111 as one scarcely know-
11ιὲΓ 1115 own language‚ and totally ignorant of all others¹’'. If this be
a reference to D'Israeli's Curiosities of Literature‚ there is probably
501110 nnstake, for no mention of O'Roddy occurs 111 that work, sofar
as the writer of these remarks can discover. At all events, what has
been said will be sufficient to vindicate the meinory of Teige O'Roddy
from the ealumny alluded to by O'Reilly, whoever was its author.
