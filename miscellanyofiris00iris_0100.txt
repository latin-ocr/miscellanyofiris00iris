allusion made to this ‘⁴ Peter Lynch of Sln·uell;” whom the Marquess, 111. p. 72, calls
“Pierce Lynch, my tenant of Shreull.⁷' The castle here belonged to his lordship.
It is situate 011 the confines of Galway and Mayo counties3 and near it an “inhumari
and barbarous massacre” was committed in February, A. D. 16413 of which see a
narrative in Lodge‘s ‘⁴ Peerage of Ireland,’' vol. ii. p. 331, first edition; and vol. iv.
p. 239, edition hy Archdan, A.D. 1789. This narrative has been compiled from the
depositions of “ Mr. John Gouldsmith, parson of Brashowle'' (B217·›·2'slzoole)‚ 111 Mayo,
and others3 which depositions are now preserved in ‘the MS. Library of Trinity Col-
lege, Dublin, F. 3. 1. The following passage, Mayo Volume, p. 5, omitted by Lodge,
may be considered curious: ‘⁴ Deponent⁷' (John Gouldsmith) “having been a Romish
Q (sic 111 orig.) and converted to the Protestant religion by the light osGod's truth,
and therefore more hated than any other by the Papists. The rebells coming to 1115 1101150
at midnight, the day of ‚ 1641, presented their sharp skeines to his throate,
robbed him then and other times of all his goods, worth about 3E5003 and foreibly ex-

 

 

pelled him from his ehurclrliving and lands, worth „8100 per annum. Having heard and
being told by some of his neighbours, that he had no waye to save his life but by going
to masse, he fied away, and was pursued by Edmond O'Maley Mc. Laugfflin, who besett
the house whither he was fied, with about 20 of 1115 111011, saying unto him, ⁶ ΜΓ. Gould-
smith doe you remember how your English have served us. How they slitt our noses
and scared our faces3 come f01·th.’ And was so bitter against this deponent, that.
had not a srier begged for him upon his knees, (as the neighbours told him) he had
eut out the deponent's tongue. At length, with much difficulty, deponent escaped to
the Lord of Mayo's house; aud was the second man that was robbed in the county os
Mayo, as 110 supposeth.” The deponent further states, among other matters also
omitted by Lodge in the narrative, that “he was 111 the county of Westmeath, as a
Protestant clergyman.'⁷ He was the 1111005101- (grandfather Ῥ) of Oliver Goldsmith, our
highly gifted poet and essayist, but snperficial and prejudiced historiam for proof of
which see that part of his History of England that treats of the affairs os Ireland in
the seventeenth century. There 15 a tradition current 111 the coun‘ties of Westmeath
and Roscommon‚ that the poet was deseended from a friar, whom the people designate
by an epithet too gross to be mentioned here. That tradition is in some degree sup-

ported
