As to the constitution of this Parliament it consisted of the spiritual and lay peers,
summoned individually‚ and of knights elected by the several counties and liberties
pursuant to writs directed to the Sheriffs and Seneschals. There is no mention of any
representatives of the cities or boroughs, wlio, however, attended the Parliament of
Kilkenny in 1310, or ofany proctors of the clergy. whose presence in these times was
probably required only when the Crown demanded an aid 01· subsidy. Until a much
later period all the members of the Irish Parlianlent sat commonly together, and occa-
sionally the most important business was transacted by a Committee, as in the Parlia-
ment of 1310 (see Rot. Pat. 3 Edw. II. 63); and in the clause Judieium Casus Dubii in
the Modus tenendi Parlianienta, which is good evidence of the practice of our Irish Par-
liaments, at least in the time os Henry the Fisth, it is provided that this Committee
should be reduced by successive elections from 2 5 to one person, “ qui a seipso descen-
dere (dissentire ?) non potest.''

Paye ις, line 8.

Dumna—The fifteen counties and liberties here named comprehendod the whole
of Ireland, which, in legal theory at least, had all been reduced to shire ground previous
to this time, and there is evidence adduced by Serjeant Mayart in his Answer to Sir
Richard Bolton, printed by lIarris in the llibernica, chiefly taken from the Plea Rolls
(zellen will they be printed Ρ), that not only in theory but in fact, the king's writ ran
through the greater part, is not through the whole, of Ircland, during the rcigns os
IIenry ΙΙΙ. and os Edward 1„ in which period the English had greater power in Ire-
land than for smne subsequent centuries. During this period, in the lang-uage of the
Irish Address to John XXII. in 1318, a document which no Irishman ean read with-
out either shame or anger, the native Irish, driven from their spacious habitations,
and hereditary lands, were compelled sor the safety of their lives to seek shelter in
the mountains, the forcsts, the bogs, and other barren places, and even in the caverns
of the rocks like wild beasts (Scotichronicon, lib. xii. c. 27), while the marchcs 01·
borders were not one definite line, (lividing thc country into two parts, but were in-
terspersed throughout the whole island whcrcvcr the barrcnness of the soil caused
it to be unoecupied by the Normans through neglect, or where the strength of the
country deterrcd them from assailing it.
