32 De Concilio He'herm'e.

Barb’d with frontlct of steel, I trow,

And with Jedwood-axe at saddle bow,

A hundred more fed free in stall,

Such was the custom of Branksome Hau.”-Scott⁹s Lay.

The doings of the Seotch mosstroopers and borderers have been made sermons
through the world, and genius has lavishcd upon them the riches of romance and
poetry3 but we have had no Walter Scott to foster a spirit of comprehensive patriot-
ism, by making us proud of our country, hy ennobling whatever was praiseworthy 111

English settlers brought with them the law os England‚ but the Irish were governed
