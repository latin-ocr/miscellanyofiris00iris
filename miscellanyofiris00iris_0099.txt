&sirpe elarus.--This inflated epitaph has been thus 11111110101151)1 translated by a
member of the Irish Archaeological Society:
‘¹ A Miiesian by birth—the soldier's dem· joy,
A very young man, but a very old boy;
From this wretched couuty to heaven he's raised,
Here lies Stephon Lynch, God Almighty be praised.”
The words “ excitatur” 111111 “ Martinus” in the text, are “ exaltatur’' and ‘⁴ Stephanus''
on the monument.

The above epitaph is only exceeded by that os the tremendous Dutch 111111111111
'l'romp‚ at Delft ς which our inditer might have had in view z ‘¹ Batavae gentis decus—
virtutis bellicae fulmen—Amor Civium—Hostium Terror—Oceani stupor—Martinus
