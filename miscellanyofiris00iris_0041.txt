Mydye.-The Lords of the liberties os Meassx, Wexford, carlom Kilkenny which
then included Ossory, and os Ulster, in 1279, were respectively—Geoffry de Geneville
or de Joinville, a name famous in European history; Aymer de Valenqffi Earl of Peni-
broke; Roger Bigod, Earl of Norsolk; Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloueester3 and
Richard de Burgh‚ Earl of Ulster: princely names and princely lofflships, but
belonging all, except the last, to Irish absentees Kildare and Leix, which, with
YVexfonl, Carlow, and Kilkenny, formed the Lordship of Leinstem and which, at the
division of the Earl Marshall's lands between his five sistas, had been assigned to
Sibilla Countess of Ferrers, and Eva de Braosa, had been afterwards again subdivided
amongst co-heiresses, and were probably now held in such small porticus, that no
seneschal was appointed for them. Iffldare, we see, had now its sheyiff³ and Leix was

probably in union with Kilkenny or Kildare, and, if no seneschal was appointed, was
subject to the Sheriff of Dublin.
