HE following compact or eovenant, which was made between

Mageoghegan, chief of Cinel-Fhiachaoh, or Kineleaghe, and the
Fox, chief of Muinter-Thadhgain (or⁷ as it is anglicised, Munna·-
hagan), on the zoth of August, 1526, is printed from the original.
now in the possession of Sir Richard Nagle, Baronet, of Jamestown
House, in tho County of Westmeath. It is written on a small piece
of parchment, in the handwriting‚ as stated, of James‚ the son of
Cairbri O⁷Kinga‚ who was present at the making of the covenant‚ and
who committed it to writing two days afterwards.

That the reader may understand the exact nature of this covenant,
it will be necessary to give here a brief sketch of the history of both
families‚ and a description of the relative situation and extent of their
territories.

I. THE FAMILY OF MAGEOGHEGAN.

This sept bore the tribe—name of Cinel or Kinel-Fhiachach,
(anglicised Kineleaghe), which name was also applied to their terri-
tory ; for the custom among the Irish was, not to take their surnames
or titles from places and countries‚ as is usual with other nations,
but to give the tribe-name of the family to the seigniory by them
possessed². This tribe name of Cinel-Fhiachach‚ was derived, as
the Mageoghegans boasted, from Fiacha, the third son of the Irish
monarch Niall of the N ine Hostages ; and their claim to this
high descent was allowed by King Georgo IV., who, as shall be
presently shewn, permitted the head of a branch of this family to
take the name of O'Neill, in the sense of descendant of Niall os

the N ine Hostages. There occurs, however, a story in the Leablmr
Breve,
