42 Decree concerning tlte Tolboll.

‚James I. finds, that James Cotterell, the last abbott of St. Thomas,
had the right of a flaggon os ale out of every brewing in the town of
Leixlip, county of Kildare.—Archtlall‚ p. 794.

Commissioners were sent over from England in 1524, to compose
the differenees between the Earl of Ormond, Lord Deputy, and the
Earl of Kildare, and to atljust other smaller matters—State PaperS,
H. 8. Vol. II. Pt. III. p. 104—one of which was the difference be-
tween the abbot of St. Thomas and the city of Dublin, as set forth
in the preceding award.

The abbot in his bill ot'eomplaint stated that the Tolboll was
granted by John when he was King of England3 it appears, however,
that the grant was made when he was only lorcl of Ireland. The
charters of John, alluded to in the connnissioners' award, are sub-
joined, copied le'terallgs from the ⁵⁴Chartae, Privilegia, 01 Inununita.tes,'’
ninety-two pages of which were printed by the late Record Commis-
sion, but not publishecl. In the margin they are said to be “E. Chart.
Dom. S. Tho. Mart. f. 21. d.'⁷ which is probably 1110 1011 compiled in
1110 111110 of Henry VIII. from the original charters, and now in the
possession of the Earl of Meath, 10 whose ancestors a great portion os
the possessions of the monastery of Thomas-Court was granted.—
Hardiman's Statute of Kilkenny, p. 28, 11010.
