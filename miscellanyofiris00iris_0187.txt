ye other parts of Ireland. Here are 2 nunnerys‚ who, keeping some-
what private, are conniv'd at by ye Governour and Mayor. At ye Gates
I observ'd ye sentinells have gotten a use os taking 2 turfs from every
horse that comes in with turs, allso, I hear, with herrings‚ (and, Ι
believe, with other things) which is much more than ye toll due to y⁰
Mayor: this greivance the officers told me they think themselves ex-
cus'd from redressing till ye eivill power thinks itself so injur'd as to
compl-ain, which, it seems, they don't yet. They have here 2 mass
houses for one church, which is indeed 11 pretty inodell'd one, but
with little ornainents3 one tomb is in it oi'very good and well polish’d
black inarble well streak⁷d with white, Ι believe from the Isles of
Bofin‘*‚ where Ι am told there is a good quarry of such. We saw
here ye Town-house, which is built on piazzas, but has nothing re-
markable, and is not yet finish’d, y⁰ Barmcks, one in ye citadell, the
other new built at another end of the town, both for foot: they hold
about a regiment. Having view'd the town, Ι was directed where 1
might have a map os ite, which Ι bought, and seems pretty exact:
’twas done at Brussells by a fryer who was born and bred in this
town, and, they tell you, had been at Brussells 8 years when he made 11.

The inhabitants, I find, are all what theycall English Irish, ἰ.- e: familys
that came over at or soon after the Conquest, and were here settled
in this strong town as a Colony against the naturall Irish of these parts,
and whose posterity still live here, and with their old religion enjoy
also their old posscssionsf.
