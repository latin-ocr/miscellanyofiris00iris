distinguished for their talents and learning, and many of them for acts of public muni-
ficence, of which various instances are recorded, See the valuable “ Historic Sketch

Dublin Penny Journal, A. D. 1833, No. 6, p. 326, sor an interesting extract from the
MS. Regal Visitation of A. D. 1615, respecting a school in Galway, in which the com-
missioners found ‘⁶ a publique schoolemaster named Lynch, placed there by the
citizens, who had great number of 5911011915, not only out of that province, but also

master³³ was the celebrated Doctor John Lynch, author of cambrensis Eversus, men-

tioned p. 68, note.
