Journey to Connauyht. 169

towers on ye walls and other old buildings within, a very venerable
appearance and pretty prospect, it being built 011 green fields, and not a
house without the walls: it seems to have been of old a well inhabited
and thriving town, on account of ye large pav⁷d streets and many ruin‘d
11011505 which remain; it has nothing now but cabins in it, and those
50 few they have roorn for all ye gardens too within ye walls, which 1
am told 01101050 more than Dublin walls, and at least 33 acres. Here
we met Sr T. Mongomeryy, who seeing 115 gaping strangers, invited
115 111 to look at his improvements, which are pretty and whimsicall
enough: part of his house is ye wing of an old Abby repair’d, which
makes an odd and convenient house. He has lately set up here a
napping and a tucking mill, and designs a weaving manufactory, the
inhabitants of the town being, as he tells me, allmost all weavers and
cottoners.

As you go out of town to Gallway you meet with a pretty new
improvement of ΜΓ. Shaw's. From hence you travell thro⁷ a barren
gravelly soyl to Gallway in 4 hours. As you draw near Gallway the
country grows extreamly stony‚ and in many places one may observe
naturall cawseys of stones, which, tho' not 50 regularly form’d as y⁰
Gyants' Cawsey 111 ye county of Antrim, are yet so like one another,
all consisting of stones full of fissures and cracks, and lying in great
laycrs or strata one over another, the fissures paralell to the horison,
that one that 5005 ’0111 can’t but rank ’em among regular form’d stones,
