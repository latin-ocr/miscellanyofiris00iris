which was 24 Days before the Death of the said Knight. The Annals or Trans-
lation, which he left behind him, begin in the year 1443, and end in 1468. Ι
suppose the Death of his Patron put a stop to his further progress. Not know-
ing from whence he translated these Annals‚ wherever Ι have occasion to quote
them, I mention them under the name of Dudlegs Firbz'sse.'⁷

Again under Richard [O’Fermff Ardagh‚ p. 2 5 3, he writes:

“ In certain Manuscript Annals intitled T lte Annals of Firbissy (not those os
Gelasy Illae Fz'rbissgs, who died in 1 301, but the Collection or Translation osone
Dudley Firbissy), I find mention made of Riclzarcl Bishop of Ardagh‚ and that
he was sone to the Grcat Dean Fla-Daniel Fit: John Gelda O Fergaill‚ and his
death placed there under the year 1444.⁷'——p. 2 54.

Here Harris refers to Annals by a Gelasy Mac F irbissy, who
died in 1301. These are probably the Annals of Lecan, now un-
known, but referred to by the Four Masters, and often quoted by
Roderic O Flaherty in the margin of the Trinity College autograph
copy of the Annals of the Four Masters [Class Η, 2. 1 1]‚ under the
title of “ MS. L.⁷' But we learn from Duald Mac F irbis himself, that
he had various MSS. and Annals of the Mac Firbises; and it is
quite evident that the present translation was made from some of
thern.

The following memorandum prefixed to a list of Bishops, collected
sor Sir J ames Ware, and now preserved in the MS. already referred
to, in the British Museum‚ will enable the reader to form some idea
of the sources from which this translation has been drawn z

“The ensueing Bishops’ names are collected out of severall Irish ancient and
modern manuscripts, viz. of Gilla-isa mac fferbisy written before the yeare 1397

( it is he that wrote the grcate booke of Leackan Mac fferbisy, now kept in
Dublin)‚ and out of others the Mac fferbisys' Annals‚ out of Saints' Calendars

and Genealogies also, sor the Right worshipful and ever honoured Sir James

&Varo Knight‚ and one of His Majestic’s Privie Council and Auditor Generall
os the Kingdome ofIreland.
