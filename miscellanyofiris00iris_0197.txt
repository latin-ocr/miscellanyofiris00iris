Part os the State Papers (Ireland), the situation of Mageoghegan's
country is described as follows:

‘⁴ Mc Eochagan’s country, called Kenaliaghc, containeth in length xij myles,
and in bredth 7 myles. It lyeth midway betweene the ffort of F aly [Philips-
town] and Athlonc‚ five myles distant from either of them, and also five myles
distant from Mollingare, which lyeth northward of it. The said Mc Eoch-
agan's country is of the countie of WVestmeth, situated in the upper end thereos
bending to the south part of the said county‚ and on the other side southward
of it is O'Moloye‘s country. And on the south east of it lyeth Offaley ς and on
the east side joyneth Terrell's country alias Ffertullagh. On the north side lyeth
Dalton's country ; and O hlelaghlen's country on the west Side between it and
Athlone, wher 11 corner of it joyneth with Dillon⁷s country.”

The territory of Cinel-Fhiachach‚ however, originally extended
from Birr‚ in the present King⁷s County‚ to the hill of Uisneacli‚ in
XVestnieath3 but subsequently the O⁷Molloys and Mageoghegans‚
who were the prineipal fiunilies os the race of Fiacha, son of N ialL
became independent of each other, and divided the original territory
into two partS, of which O'Molloy retained the southern portion,
called Feara-CealL and Mageoghegan the northern portion, which
retained the original name of the tribe. In the year 1207, 'both
families were nearly dispossessed by Meyler F itz-Henry and the sons
of Sir Hugh de Lacy, who, in this year, contended with each other
for the lands of Cinel-Fhiacha0h‚ as appears from the fistlowing entry
in the ΑΗΒ-1113 of Cloninacnoise, translated by Connell Mageoghegan:

“ A. D. 1207. The sons of Hugh Dchxsie, with the forces of the English
ofMeath, laid siege to the eastle ofArdfflurcher, and the same continued lor
the space of five weeks, until they forced Mcyler to abandon and forsake ull the
cantred of Kynaleaghe from Birr to Killare.'‘

Sir Richard Nagle, Bart.‚ now inherits the property os the last
chieftain of the Mageoghegans, froni whom he is maternally de-
scended. Another branch of them was removed by Cronlwell to the

castle
