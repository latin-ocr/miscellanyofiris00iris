Clzcain-Corpqzs.—All our topographical writers have mistaken the situation of this
celebrated monastery. Itis written CLuum compe! by the Four Masters. In the
Fez'lire Aenyuz's, at the 15111 of February, it is described as ι nouem& cenet οοδέα
ιςοοηηαόεωῧ, i. e. “in the desert or wilderness of Kinel-Dofa 111 Connaught.” In
a marginal note in an autograph copy of the Annals of the Four Masters, preserved
in the Library of Trinity Collego, Dublin‚ ad. ann. 1405, O'Flaherty adds, from
O’Mulconry's Annals, that Cluain-Coirpthe is situated “In maryz'ne Sinannz· fletvii.’'
The place is still well known to the natives of Slieve Eamne, in the east of the county
os Roscommon, who point out the ruins of St. Barry's monastery in a claein, or bog-
island, in the townland of Kilbarry, near the briuk of the Shannon, in the parish of
Termonbarry, 111 the desert of Kinel-Dofa, or O'Hanly’s country. Archdall, and from
him all the topographieal Irish writers to the present day, have asserted that Cluain
Coirpthe‚ where a monastery was founded by St. Berach in the sixth century, is the
church os Clooncraff, which Archdall places in the barony of Athlone, in the county
of Roscommon, but this assertion. which has led so many astray, involves a double
error, for Cluain-Coirpthe is not Clooncraff, nor is Clooncraff in the barony of Ath-
lone.—See the Editor's edition of the Annals of the Four Masters, at the years 1238,
p. 294, and 1405, p. 783, where Cluain-Coirpthe is proved to be Kilbarry in Ter-
monbarry, on the brink of the Shaunong aud at the year 1488, p. 1157, where it is
proved that Clooucraff, lying to the east 01'E1phin 111 the barony os Roscommon, in
Mac Branan’s country, is the place called by the Annalists Cluain-Creamha‚ i. e. the
nmadow, or pasturage, of the wild gai-lic, which was one of St. Finnen's ehurehes.

this great fortress, which was built 111 the thirteenth century by the Fitzgeralds, and
afterwards wrm-,sted from them by the O'Dempsvys, is situated near the read, 011 the
right bank of the river Burrow, 111 the barony of Portnahinch, about three miles to

the west os Mumsterewn, aud one mile to the south os Portarlington.
