Teohalcljs (le Ver1l0n.-Theobald de Verdon, 5011 of Margery de Lacy, and Geoffry
de Genevillo, husband of Matilda de Laey, 1110 grand-daughters and oo-heiresses of
XValter de Lauy, held the Lordship of Meath 111 purparty. Loghseudy and Trim were
1110 heads of their respective moieties. The bouuds os these 1110101105 11 would perhaps
be difficult to aseer-mim and it would appear that de Genevssle⁴s Liberty of Trim ex-
tended into the present county ofW'estmeath. Ros. Par. 20. Ed. ΙΙΙ. 3. De Verdon’s
nioiety was not limited 011 1110 west by the bounds ofXVestmeath. The present county os
Longsord, and even part of Roseommon‚ were included 111 1115 portion of hleath, 11005-
medi (Loghseudy). Moydewe (Moychm), and Adleck (Athleague), were amongst the
possessions forming part ofMeath, which were confirmed 10 111111 111 the 12th year,
Ed. Ι. Lit. Antiq. 9. De Verdon’s moiety was seized into the Kiug's hands, either by
Henry ΙΙΙ. (Bor. Por. 3 ἃ 4 Ed. Π. 50), or by Edw. Ι. (Ros. Pul. 2 Heu. V. 137), and
does not appear 10 have been restored 10 111111, or to his 5011.

Ι11 1330 the whole Liberty, with au 115 privileges, was reunited in favour of Roger
Morthner, Earl of March, and husband os J oa11‚ heiress of Geoffry de Geneville, from
whom it deseended through the Earls os March, and Richard Duke of York, to King

Edward IV.‚ and was finally annexed to the Crown by Henry VII. P
