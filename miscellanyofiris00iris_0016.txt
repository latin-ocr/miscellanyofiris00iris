It is to be regretted that two words occurring in this poem, which
appear to denote two 01 111056 01116615,111111161γψῐιεοῑ1 and Γομῡαη, are
not to be found in any of the pnblished Irish Dictionaries, nor in any
of the MS. Dictionaries or Glossarics accessible in Dublin. They are
probably names for 01116115, 11111 111 1116 absence 01 1116 proper evi-

irrevocably come to pass, and therefore that all things are fixed by
an absolute deeree‚ and cannot be changed by any exertions of

The Irish text is printed exactly as it stands in the MS„ exeept-
ing that the contracted words have been given at length. The
reader will observe that many consonants are 1611 unaspirated, which
are pronounced and written with aspiration in the modern Irish
