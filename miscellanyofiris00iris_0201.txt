Covenmzt between Illayeoqlteycm (md the Foan 187

By comparing this line with that of Mageoghegan⁷s pedigree,
above given, we must conclude, from the number of generations, that
this Niall was contemporary with Congalach More Mageoghegan, who
flourished in the thirteenth century. He was probably the Niall
Sinnach, or F0x‚ chief of Muinter-Thadhgain, who was killed in the
battle of Athcnry‚ in the year 1316. It is quite clear that there
were four or five generations between this N iall and the Breasal who
made this covenant with Mageoghegan, in 1 526. Of these, the
document itself furnishes two, viz.‚ Eoghan‚ his father, and Cairbri,
his grandfather3 and the Annals of the Four Masters will probably bc
found to supply the remaining ones ; for, under the year 1446, they
record the death of Cucogry, chief of Tesfia, son of Maine, who was
son of the Sinnach, or Fox, lord of the men of Teffia. The probability
is, that this Cucogry was the brother of Cairbri‚ the grandfather
of the Breasal who made the covenant in 1526. If sc, the remainder
of the pedigree will stand thus:

At what period, or wheresore, the O’Caharnys of Teffia first as-
sumed the name of Sinnach, or Fox, it is now not easy to determine.
It would appear from the Irish Annals, that Tadhg, or Teige
O’Caharny‚ King of Teffia, who was slain in 1084, was the first
called Sinnach. In thc old translation of the Annals of Ulster is the
following entry, which traces the name Sinnach to a very opprobrious

origin ; but where the translator found authority for it the Editor is
