¹⁰ Nothz'nffl is to befi’ared bg( παπ-Νῶε),
is a negative particle equal to the modern
ni, or the c'c1 of Ulster and Erse dialects
of the Gaelic. It always eclipses the initial
consonant of the word which follows it,
and reqm'res n prefixed if that word be-
gins with a vowel.

¹¹ Nor g'f'I were sixt-q hundred—This is
a mode os expression very usual in the
Irish Annals, and is not unlike the Eng-

Ccnngen mo ῧάιΓ, signifies the compact,

word offingen is evidently used here in
a figurative sense to denote the time fixed
