The soregoing Charters are of a date some centuries later than
that of the Book of Kells itself‚ in which they are found 3 and it will
be necessary to distinguish between the date of the Charters‚ i. e. of
the contracts to which they relate, and of the copies now extant in
the Book of Kells, which were probably transcribed from the original
deeds into this sacred and venerable book in order to secure their
preservation. The ink has in many places so faded that several words
are illegible3 and this appears to have been the case even in the time
of Ussher, who had faithful transcripts of the first six of them made
into a paper book, now preserved among his manuscripts in the
Library of Trinity College, Dublin (E. 3. 8.) These transcripts‚
although not always accurate, have preserved some words which
have been since destroyed by the bookbinder.

That the hand-writing of these documents, as they are now found
in the Book of KeHs, is not coeval with the persons whose names
are mentioned in them, is evident from the fact that they appear to
have been transcribed, at the same time, whereas it is quite obvious
that Nos. ΙΙ. and IV. are at least half a centtuy older than No. I.
The period at which they were transcribed into this book may be
conjectured from the character of the writing and the. eontractions,
which would appear to belong to the latter part of the twelfth cen-
tury ; but the dates of the deeds themselves can be pretty accurately
fixed⁷ from the notices of the deaths of the parties coneerned, which
are recorded in the Irish Anu-als, and will be given in the following
remarks

These Charters are exceedingly interesting to the historiari, as
proving that the ancient Irish had committed their eovenants to
writing in their own language before the Anglo-Norlnan invasion 3
