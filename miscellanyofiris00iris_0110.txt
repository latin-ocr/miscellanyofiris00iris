96 Poem by Gratianus Lucius,

Sedibus et faustus tenuit quos casus anilis,
exhaustos vietus non nisi pauper alit.
Qui fortunati me discedente fuerunt,
vel vit-st dudum vel caruere bonis.

Res igitm· patriae mentem vel lumina laedent,
certa secl exilio 1100 est inihi parta salus.
Est mihi sola salus peregre discriminis expers

in patri-si nil quam triste videre lieet,
Tranquillum mentis statum praepono dolori.
Ergo peregrina est vita colenda mihi.

land ?’' ancl in it he has detailed, in an affeeting strain, 1110 several reasons which de-
1011οἀ 111111 from so doing. It was probably unfinished, as some few false quantities may
