Almarico (le Sancto Amancla-Lyneh supposes that the lands which Almarie de St.
Amaud held frou] Theobald de Verdon, were those four carucates of land called ‘⁸ le
Ryn‚⁷’ which formerly belonged to Ua-gorrnan the Irishrnan, and Which were confirmed
to him by Henry ΙΙΙ, (Lynch, Dignities, 159); but this supposition is not free from
difficulties. In 1425, Sir John Talbot, afterwards Earl of Shrewsbury, was Lord of
Loxeuedy, as on(¹ of the representatives of De Verdon, and his tenant was Henry
M‘Adam.-R0t. Par. 3 Hen. VI. 112. In the time of Sir Henry Piers the memory of
Theoba1dVe1·don was still preserved in the neighbourhood of Lough Seudy, in the
name of Maghere Tibbot, and in a tradition of his death in a battle said to have been
fought there iu the time os Henry VIII.

Ixyldarie.—In the patent of the Earldom of Kildare, granted to John Fitz Thomas,
in 1316, the office of Sheriff was specially reserved, but in the following year the
liberty was revived in his favour, and the office of Sheriff, which seems to have been
the essential distinction of a liberty, was conferred upon him (Bor. Pac. 11 Ed. II. 17),
and was possessed by his descendant in the reign of Henry VIII.

&saradim—These Marches are not to be confounded with the English Pale, the
narrow district in the vicinity of Dublin, which in the fifteenth century aeknowledged
English authority, but which never formed the limit of English power in Ireland.

concordarunt—A comparison os the enactments of this Parliament with the recog—
nizance of the English aud Irish wardens, and the indenture os Erle Gerr-alde of Kil-
dare, in 1524 (State Papers, vol. ii. part iii. pp. 108, 18), will shew, that in the
intervening centuries, no progress had been made by the English in good government‚
while their power had gradually diminished, and will prove the vanity of all legal pro-
visions which depend for their execution on the will of the people, when they are
made in opposition to national habits and circumstances. To improve a people by
legislation there needs a strong govermnent.
