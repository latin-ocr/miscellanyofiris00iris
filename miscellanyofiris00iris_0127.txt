County of Leitrim, was the lineal representative of the O‘Roddys‚ who
were Comlzarbs, i. e. the hereditary sarmers or wardens of the ehurch-

lands belonging to the monastery os Fenagh.

His genealogy is prc-

served in the book of Fenagl1‚a MS. of which an exact and beautisully
written fac simile copy, in the handwriting of Mr. O'Donovan, is pro-

served in the Library of tho Royal Irish Academyf.

conry, who transcribed that volume, A. D. 1517, for Teige O‘Roddy‚
an ancestor of the subject of the present memoir, has given (sol. 46, b.)
