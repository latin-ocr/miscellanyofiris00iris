14 Poem attributed to St. Colamblcille.

to have been the following: immediately after the decision of the
King of Ireland, which was given against Columbkille⁷s right to the
transcript he had made of St. F innen's Psalter‚ the saint having pro-
tested against the king's judgment, retired into the monastery of
S. Boetius (now Monasterboiee) “ubi ab amicis praemonitus est⁷'
(says O’DonnelL Vit. S. Columbae, ap. Colgan‚ Tri-as Th, p. 409)
“in monte Bregh [now Sliabh Brey], per quein sequenti die iter sac-
turus erat, insidias ei a Rege Diermitio et suis parari, ne qua 1111 ad

suos cognatos via pateret.

Quare ut postera dies illuxit, propositum

iter prosecuturus, solus et sejunctus a sociis, quos aliam viam carpere
jussit, montem conscendit, ac quemadmodum et socii, divinis canticis
intentus seciu⁴e ae aemulis invisus percurrit?

The same event is more fully related 111 an Irish Life of St.
Columbkille‚ in the collection ofMess1·s.}10dges and Smith‚ in which
the present poem is expressly quoted as having been composed by

him on this occasion :

‘⁴ Then Columbkille said, Ι will go unto
my brethren the Kinel Connell and Kinel
Owen, and I will give thee battle in re-
turn for the iniquitous judgmeut thou
gavest against me in the case of the book,
and in revenge for killing the son os the
King of Connaught while under my pro-
tection. For I (leem it not sufficient that
God shall take vengeanee on thee (here-
after) unless I myself take vengeance on
thee 111 this lise. Then the King of Ire-
land commanded that not one of the men
of Ireland should eonvey Columbkille out
of the palace, or join him in opposition to
himself.

‘⁶ Columbkille‚ however, left the palace
without the King of Ireland's consent,

and such was the providence of God over
him
