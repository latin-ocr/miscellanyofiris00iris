En Tuane.—Properly an t-uan, i. e. the Lamb. It is rather a eurious circumstance,
that this sobriquet, if it be one, has continued in the Lynch family for upwards of 400
years. The writer hereof was acquainted with a respectable merchant ofGalway, who
was called Thomas Lynch Lamb. But the good people there are noted for giving fa-
miliar nicknames to each other, and these (generally ridiculous) adjuncts mostly cou—
tinue for life. A late member of the family in question was called “Lynch Ram,”
and another is stated to have been dubbcd ‘⁴ Lynch God damn;'' but this latter indi-
vidual resided for a long time in Enghnd, and there acquired the national impre-
cation, by which he was afterwards so unenviably distinguished. It is well known that
Englishmcn were formerly so addicted to that profane phrase, that the French called
them indiscriminately “Godammees;⁷’ for which, among other old authorities, see the
History of the Maid of Orleans. Its prevalence among them, even to our own time, is
commemorated in Lord Byron's poem, Don Juan, cauto xi. stanza xii.

The yreae brMye—This bridge is still standing and in good repair. The rapid
river which runs under it, here called “ the river of Lockcorb.-—Corbium fluvium,”
tlows from the great lake Corrib, anciently called Lough Orbsen. See O’Flaherty’s
Ogygia, p. 16; and Wcst Connaught‚ p. 20, note ¹². This river was never known by
the name ‘⁴ corbium fluviu1n‚’' but it is always mentioned in our annals as the river
Gaz'lle'mk, anglicized Galway3 and from it that town and county have been named.

Gott leis own son leanyecl.-See further on in the text, sor the testimony of Doctor
‹James Lyuch, Arehbishop of Tuam, whercin allusion is made to this well-known story3
which, it is stated, was then publickly “believed throughout all the province-'³ This
testimony, at the time, was highly respectable, as to the popular belief; and though
at the present day it may be considered ancient testimony, yet it cannot be taken us
conclusive on a transaction which occurred nearly two eenturies before it was given.
The Rev. Edu-ard Groves, os Dublin, who has conunemoratcd this occurrence iu a
beautiful and successful dramatic production, entitled the “VVurden of Gulway‚”
considers it as a popular story founded on fiction, well adapted sor the genius os
poetry, but inadmissible as an historic fact. without better evidence thau has been
hitherto adduced in its support. If the ancient “book in folio,¹‘ mentioned p. 68, note.
be ever recovered, it will either authenticate or invulidate this curious story.
