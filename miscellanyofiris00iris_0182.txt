illamday, 19‘fit—At Killconnell we saw the famous old Abby of
Franciscans. where was little os antiquity or remarkable. Their
churchyard is 511110111111011 bya wall of dead men‘s'sekulls and bonesu,
pil’d very orderly, with their faces outwards, clear round against the
wall to the length of 88 foot, about 4 high, and 55 4³¹¹· broad, so that
there may be possibly here 10 1110 number of 50000 sckulls: within
they shew you Lf¹ Gallway's and other great nien’s heads kill'd at
Aghriin. This Abby was in repair, and inhabited by Fryers, in K.
Janies⁷ time, so that some of the woodwork, the wainscot, and ordi-
nary painting yet reinains; nay I ain told 2 of ye Fryers are yet
alive, and live, tho’ blind with age, on ye charity of the neig[h]bouring
papists, 111 a poor cabin, in a very small island, which they shew’d me,
not 3 a mile froin KillconelL in a bog: they einploy one to begg for
themv, and by that means subsist near their old habitation.
