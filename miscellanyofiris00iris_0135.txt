antient bookes of boland, and that learned, and understands thern as well at least,
as any now in boland, or any where, all which paines I take sor my eountrye's
sake, for my owne satisfacti0n‚ and to preserve so noble and singular a monu-
ment of honor and antiquity, &e.

“ The very bookes that the Milesi-an antiquaryes brought into Ireland,
tho' transcribcd since by other able hands, wee have, and I have the Chronicle
os Ireland continued from Parhalan's coming into Ireland, 300 ycares after the
Flood, to this present age, of the several invasions, colonyes, warres‚ kingS, ge-
nealogys, descents‚ etc. of the nationn ε Milesius Hispanus was the 26th descent
from Japhet inclusively, and the 36th off Adam, so that it was easy to preserve

so many descents. Thus:

“ Milesius Hispanus (vulgo vocatus
Gathelus) filius fuit Bilei, is Brigantii, is
Brathae, is Deafflae, is Archadae, is Al-

So that you see how easy it was to preserve so many deseents from Noe, or
Adam, to the Milesian invasion, they being the greatest lovers of learning in
the world, their predecessor, Ninlus fitz Fenius Farsaeus, being borne at the
Towcr when a building, and a little before the confusion, and the onely inan
in the world that learned the 72 languages, and taught them, etc„ as our chro-
nicles sette forth at large, T hen when the Milesians came into Ireland‚ they had
along with them their antiquaryes‚ bards, Druides, men ofextraordinary learning,

who sett up publique schools, taught publiquely without sallary, having large es-
tates
