Daniel O-Donell was made King against Rowry O-Donell‚ but
o-Dogherty (by deceite) tooke the said Daniel prisoner 111 his own
house after y‘. Then Rowry gathered Mae Vgilin, and O-Cahan
with their forces, and they altogether went, and besiedged O-Dogher—
tyes eastle, [Inch] wherin the said Daniel O-Donell was kept, and
few men (as keepers and wayters) with him, aboute Cathal O-Dufl'-
dirma. Rowry coming to the Castle did burne the tower dore,
wherby the stayres was sett on fire so that the host could not enter
the Castle ; in the meane time Daniel desired Cathal O-Duffdirma
to loose his fetters, saying‚ that it was more decent sor him to be so
slaine, than in his givves. Soe Cathal taking compassion on his cause,
and certifying himselfe that he could not escape by any meanes, but
that he should be slaine as soone as his enimyes should met him
within the Castle, loosed his irons. Then iffiediately Daniel went to
the topp of the tower, where he ἓξὲξ the onely happiest throw
or cast (that was ever east in Irland, since *Ludh lamoda cast the
tathluibh) towards Rowry, and hit him with a greate stone, so that
he was instantly bruised all to the ground, so that neither Priest
nor Clarke might find him aliue, and by that throw Daniel defended
his own soule and body with the Lordship of T irconnell to himselst,
and the Army that came full of pride and boasting retired with
saddnesse and disdaine.
