hold, and that no one saw him depart from
the place or out of their presence, and he
went that night to St. Boetius; and the
people of the place said unto him to go sor
safety upon Sliabh Breagh on the follow-
ing day, sor they said that the king's people
would be before him to intercept and cap—
ture him. The King did place a company
of his people on the way. Columbkille
arose early the next morning, and directed
his people to go by a separate course over
the mountain, while he followed another
path alone. It was 011 that occasion he
made the poem,

‘⁴ Alone I am on the mountain,
O royal sun of prosperous way,
To me no danger is apprehended,
Any more than if I were three §core
hundred str0119.'’
