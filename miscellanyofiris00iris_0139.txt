Crye to the Lord to give you a plaine, single heart.

Take heede of beinge over jealous, least your apprehensions of
others cause you to offend⁷ knowe that uprightnesse Will preserve
you, in this bee confident against men.

Ι thinke the Anabaptists are too blame in not beinge pleased w‘¹¹
you, that’s their fault, it will not reach you whilest you W¹¹¹ single-
nesse of hcart, make the glory of the Lord‚ your ayme.

Take heede of professinge religion w¹'¹out the power, that will
teach you to love all whoe are after the similitude of Christ.

Take care of niakinge it a businesse to bec too hard sor the meu
