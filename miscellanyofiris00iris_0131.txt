displays all the enthusiasm and some of the credulity so common at
that period with Irish antiquaries. At the end we find, in the hand-
writing of the venerable Charles O‘Conor, of Belanagare, the following
note:

truth and falsehood mingled together
are in it ; for Teige was a credulous
author, who did not observe a proper
distinction between the infancy and
the perfection of the history of this

may be added the following extract, from a letter addressed by Mr.
O’Donovan, in July, 1845, to the writer of these remarks, in reply
to some inquiries respecting the character and history of Teige

O’Roddy :

“ Teige was a remarkable man, and a great linguist, but he was in the
nens· Leonbmt'), or second childhood, when he wrote his letter to Lhwyd. He
wrote Latin as well as O'Flahcrty, and seems to have been educated abroad. Hc
was certainly a peop otu-ge, or lawyer, and practised in the reign of James II.,
but whether as an attorncy orbam-ister Ihave not been able to determine. He
went to England in 1688, on legal business, and returned home visi Scotland.

O’Fergus do still at Rossinver. 1 examined the site oshis house at Fcnagh in 1837,
