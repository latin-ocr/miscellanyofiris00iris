For some further particular-s of Dr. Dominick Lynch, see De Bnrgo in Hibernia
Dominicana, p. 545, where he adds : “ Caeterum nullus dubito, quin reliquam quoque
Pliysieam Naturalem ediderit. Immo ῑι multis me audivisse Hispanis memini, prze-
clarum hune Virmn lucubrasse integrum Cursum Theologkzum, sed, dum Mari depor-
taretur ex Hispania in Galliam Typis tradendus, Naufragio periisse.” The same work,
and VVare's Writers, contain notices ofother members of this name, contemporary with our
venerable Regent3 particularly Ductor John Lynch‚ author of several learned works,
the 111-1110111111 of which is his celebrated book entitled CAMBRENSIS Evnnsns, published
under the name of Gratianus Lucius. 1111111055.Α1111.Μ,1)0.1,Χ11. An interesting poem

⁸* In vetusto collegii libro Dominieuin Lynchaeum cognomento nigrum anno salutis 1505,
mortuum intimum Collegii fundatorem fuisse leqz'J’ Diligent search has been recently
made by the Editor for this old volume, but without success. It is supposed to have
been taken to the continent 1))1 some of the clergy who were obliged to fly thither
during 1110 troubles of the seventeenth century. But see further on in 1110 text
sor the testimony of Daniel Nelly, vicar, in which 110 states, that the old and new col-
legiate registers were 1051 by ncgligence, 111 A. D. 1652. It 15 now ascertained, that
at that time, several other historieal documents were destroyed throughout Ireland.
In the MS. Library of Trinity College Dnblin, I.4‚ 13, there 15 preserved “ A Paper
Book in 16⁰-7 written in the last (i. e. the seventeenth) centnry3 containing an account
of the town of Galway, the arins, and first settling of the families:” but 11115 latter
MS. is now of little or 110 value.
