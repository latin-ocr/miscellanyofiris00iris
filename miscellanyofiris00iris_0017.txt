retaining the sounds of many consonants, which are now aspirated3
but there is no direct proofof this, as the same letter in the same
grammatica] situation is found sometimes aspirated and sometimes
not, in the most ancient Irish MSS. extant. These aspirations were
obviously sometimes omitted through merc carelessness of transcri-
bers, and perhaps sometimes intentionally‚ especially on those letters
which were always pronounced as aspirate, as b in the termination
of the ablativc case plural, and 0 111 1110 termination of active parti-
ciples or progressive active nouns; so the F rench consider it unne-
ccssary to mark the <l 111 bled, corn, &c.‚ the pronunciation of the
word being well known to be hle. The same observations will hold
good with respect to eclipsed consonants, sor the eclipsing letter is
most generally omitted in the most ancient MSS„ for this reason,
apparently, because the grammatical structure of the sentence would
in most instances point out to the native whether the consonant was
to be eclipsed or not.

The only marks introduced by the Editor are hyphens⁷ apostrophes,
and stops, which 110 thinks necessary to the prcservation of the lan>
guagc in proper form—See some very judicious observations 011 this
