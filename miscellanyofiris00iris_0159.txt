Carn Mountains. Lanigan, in his Ecclesi-
stical History of Ireland, vol. ii. p. 100, is
puzzled to distinguish the territories of
Carbury in Meath fron] each other 3 and
Duald Mac Firbis falls into an error in plac-
ing Cairbre Ua g-Ciardha in Conmhaicne
Maighe Rein, i. e. Mac Rannall's country,
in the country ofLeitrim. See his Genealo-
gical work (Mal-quis of Drogheda's copy,
p. 217). But the exact situation ofCairbre-
Gabhra and Cairbre-O'g-Ciardha can be
easily deterniined fron] the topographical
poenis ofO'Dugan and O‘Heerin, in which
O'Ciardha is placed in Leinster‚ south of
the Eiscir Riada, and O'Ronan, Cliief of
Cairbre Gabhra, in the ancient Meath.

The fact is that Cairbre-O'g-Ciardha is the
present barony of Carbury in the county
of Kildare, and Cairbre-Gabhra is the
present barony of Granard in the county
of Longford. where the sons ot'Cairbre,
the son of Niall, were seated in St. Pa-
trick⁷s time, to whom they granted a beau-
tiful place called Granard. See O'Flaher-

ty’s Offizsffl'a, part iii. c. 85. The following·
entry in the Annals ot* Connaught, at the
year 1420, will shew that the castle of
Granard was in the territory of Cairbre
Gabhra: ‘⁸ Conplen δῃαησιῃο ι Couppne

nard, in Cairpre Gabrai, was taken froin
William O'Farrcll by the English. The
English afterwards abandoned the cassse,
and William deinolished it from sear of
the English.'' The mountainous parts os
this barony still retain the name Cairbre,
and the vivid traditions in the country
respecting the curse pronounced by St.
Patrick on the territory, where he was
treated with indignity by the incredulous
Cairbrc, the monarch⁷s brother, shew
clearly that the district about Granard
was originally called Cairbrc. This isifur-
ther corroborated by the account of the
Attacottic tribes in Ireland in the second
century, preserved in the Book of Lecan,
and transcribed by Duald Mac F irbis
