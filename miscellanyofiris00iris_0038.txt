24 De Concilio Hibernia

Dublin, sol. 6-8. From this venerable record it has been most carefully transcribed,
and it is here printed as it stands in the original MS„ without any alteration, except
that osprinting the contraeted words at full length, and the correction of 1116 following
manisestly clerical errors, viz: title, magmate-s pro magmatoffl page 16, line 25, jare
projuroe page 18, line 3, curie pro curm,- page 18, line 18, competenter pro commentor,-

Hic ad hnncdiem.-Tl1ere is some uncertainty both as to the time and the place of
holding this Parliament. It was probably held 111 Dublin, and 1116 time must have
been between 1289, in which year William, Archbishop of Tuam, was consecrated, and
1303, when N icholas M‘Molissa, Archbishop of Armagh, died, both os whom are men—
tioned in 1116 record as absent. The date commonly assigned is 1295, but Sir william
Betham, having found the accounts of Walter Hac-he, Sheriff of Louth, and Richard
'sante SheriffofDublin, who returned their writs to this Parliament, on the great
roll of the Pipe, for the 28th os Edw. I., 1297, has fixed it in that year3 but isthis was
the case Harl-is 15 wrong in stating in 1115 Synoptical Table, that &Vogan the Justieiary,
in whose presence this Parliament was held, was absent from thc Govcrnment of Ire-
land t'rom 1296 to 1298. Sir John lVogan had 1611615 of credence to the Irish nobles,
in October, 1295 (Rymer, vol. i. p. 829), and on May 13th‚ 1296, with the Earl of
Ulster and the Irish nobles in his company, 116 was feasted by King Edward at the
Castle of Roxhurgh (Pemhridge 111 anno). 11 may be worth noticing that in 1296, 1116
year in which 1116 Steward surrendered his castle of Roxburgh, Edward 1. confirmed a
grant made to the Steward by the Earl os Ulster, of the Castle and Borough del Roo,
in 11·eland.-R0t. ἱη, Tur. Lonrl. 24 Ed. 1.

C‹›mitihns,-The Roll of the persons who attended this Parliament has not been pre-
served. The 1151 which Sir R. Cox presents to 1116 reader, and which 15 hore given, to
show, as 116 says, what sort of Parliaments were in Ireland in those days, 15 1116 list of
the twenty-eight persons, to whom, on the 18th of October, 1295, Sir John lVogan
had letters of crcdcnce, and who may have been 501116 of 1110 Peers or Knights of
this Parliament. It is probable that a greater number was summoned, as 111 1310
eighty-six Peers had write of summons. Richard de Burgh, Earl of Ulster ς Geoffry
