Cmmwell, as Leland stateS‚ was recalled from Ireland aster his father⁷s¹
death, he “retired to a house in the Phoenix Park‚ having admi-
nistered the government with such disregard to his private interest,
that he could not immediately command so much money as might
defray the expenses of a voyage to England.'⁷—Hi3t. qf lrelcmd, vol. iii.

HE following Irish deeds are printed from the splendid M S. of

the Gospels called the Book of Kells, preserved in the Library
of Trinity College⁷ Dublin, which, there is every reason to believe,
was executed in the time of St. Columbkille. It would be out
of place here to attempt a description of this MS, or to put toge-
ther the evidenees of its antiquity. It must suffice to observe‚ that
the existence of the following charters‚ which have been copied into
it, is sufficient to connect it with the monastery of Kells3 and that it
was in existence there in the year 1006, and then regarded as one
of the most splendid relies of the western world, will appear from
the following entry in the Annals of Ulster‚ under that year:

⁵¹ This passage is also given in the An-
nals of the Four Masters, at the year
1006, and a translation of it by Colgan

“Almo Domini 1006 (alias 1007). The
great Gospelof Colunib-kille was sam-ih·-
giously stolen at night out of the western
porticus os the great church of Kells. This
was the chief relic of the west of the world
on account ofthe singular cover. This Ges-
pel was found in twenty nights and two
months, with its gold stolen off, and a sod
over ita.
