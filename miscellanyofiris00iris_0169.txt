It follows, therefore, that the year 1084 is the latest date that cau
be assigned to the Charter before us.

No. HL—PAGF, 13 2.

The date of this Charter 15 fixed to the latter part of the
eleventh century by our knowledge of the obits of three of the
persons mentioned in it, namely, O'Clueain,C01nharba of Kells3 the.
Bishop O'Dunan; and Donnell, the 5011 of Flann, King of Tara.
According to the Aunals of Ulstor aud the Four Masters, Fer-
‹lomhnaeh O'Clucain‚ Comharba of Kells, died in the year 1114.
The death of Maelmuire O’Dunan7 archbishop‚ 15 entered in the
Annals of Ulster‚ the Annals of the Four MasterS, and the interpo-
lated copy of the Annals of Iuisfallen7 at the year 11173 but they
differ as to the name of his see. The Four Masters call him Arch-
bishop of Minister, and the Annals of Inisfallen Archbishop of Ire-
land. The old translation of the Annals osUlster makes mention of
two prelates of this name who died in 1117, namely‚ “ Maolmure
()'Dunan, chief Bishop of the 111511, and head of Ireland, clergy and
laitye, sor alme& &03 and “ Maohnure O'Dunan‚ Archbishop of Mun-
ster.'⁷ In Mageoghegan’s translation of the Annals of Clonmacnoise,
at the year 1100, where an account 15 given os a synod held that year
at Cashel, he is called “ O’Downan, arch Bushopp and Elder of Ire-
land.'‘ In Harris⁷ edition of YVare's Bishops, p. 467, ‘⁴ Miler or
Mehnury O'Dunam Archbishop of CasheL is said to have died at
Clonard, on the 24th of December, 1118, 111 the 77th year of 1115 age.
And again, in the list of the Bishops os Meath, p. 140, “Idwzcm‚ called
Bishop of Meath, is said to have fiourished in 1096.'' The fact would
appear to be that there was but one O⁷Dunan‚ and that he was Bishop
os Meath, and that ‘⁵ head os the clergy of Irelandfor alm‹‘s,'' 11115 been
understood as meaning archbishop, when7 111 reality‚ it means nothing
