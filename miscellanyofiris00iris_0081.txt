Pedigree of Doctor Domm'clc Lynclz. · 67

there. Upon that occasion a commissioner was dispatched to Ireland, “to make due
insormations of the pedigree‚ life, and behaviour of Doetor Domnick Lynch.'’ After a
solemn investigation, on which the most authentic records were produced, and wit-
nesses the most respectable examined3 the foregoing pedigree and report were re-
turned, exhibiting prooss of linenge, supposed sufficient to satissy even the proudest of
the grandees of Spain. That it did prove satisfactory may be concluded from this,
that the venerable individual in question filled the high offices to which he was elected,
with honour and applause, for nearly a quarter of a century after. This document may,
therefore, be deomed a fair specimen of the testimonials considered necessary sor cle-
rical emigrants from Ireland, during the period alluded to. At another opportunity,
similar specimens may be given of those required by persons engaged in civil and mi-
litary occupatious. It may here be observed, that these curious evidences of family
descent are deserving os more attention than they appear to have received in latter
times. Many os them contain historical notices of persons and incidents not elsewhere
to be found. Our learned Ulster King of Arms, Sir William Betham, is, Ι believe,
aware of the valuc and importanec of these documents. They should, therefore, as
far as possible, be collected and preserved with care in a public repository, where
they might prove serviceable in helping to correct some of the numerous misstate-
ments contained in modern books of peerage and genealogy.

Doctor Domnick &mela—Hatris, in his edition os Ware’s Irish WVriters, book i.
vol. ii. p. 2 58, gives the following account of this learned ecclesiastic and his writings;
and it seems to have been drawn from correct sources ofinformation: “Dominio-lc Lince,
(Lyncle) was born in the county of Galway, and admitted into the Dominican Order in
Spain, where hc lived many years in great Reputation, officiating as Synodal Judge
under the Archbishop os Sec-ille. He was gradually promoted to all the Honours of
that Uniwrsity, was first Lccturer in Arts aud Philosophy, then Master of the students,
Secondary, and at length principal Regent, afterwards made professor of Divinity in
1674„ which Officc he held with universal Approbation until the year 1697, when
he died at Seve'lle. He was in such great Esteem in Spain, that Nicholas Antonio
(Biblioth. Ilispuu. v. 2. p. 358) hath with much Honour ranked him among the Writ—
ers os that country. He hath written, according to the Publishers of the Dominican
Bibliotheque:
