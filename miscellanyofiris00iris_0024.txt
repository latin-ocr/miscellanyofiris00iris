Poem attributed to St. Columblcille.

A guard
One niay bring with him on his path,
But what protection, what—
Has guarded him from deathae?

An herb is eut for the kine
After their coming fron] the mountain;
What induces the owner of the kine
Not to eut an herb for himselfffl?

No son of a inan doth know
For whom he maketh a gathering‚
WVhether it is a gathering for himself

Or a gathering for another person²⁸. 40

tive or antidotal herb given to kine after
their removal from the summer pasture in
the mountain, to a more sheltered place in
the winter:, but the Editor has never
heard of any such eustom remaining at
the present day. This quatrain would
be written as follows in the modern
Irish: beoncop lup oo no humb, rap

construction of this quatrain is exaetly
